# Corm Brain

## Overview

Corm-brain is the AI reasoning engine for Frontier Corm. It observes player events from one or more game environments (via WebSocket or HTTP fallback from `puzzle-service`), generates contextual responses using locally-hosted LLMs (NVIDIA TRT-LLM on DGX Spark), and writes corm state transitions to the Sui blockchain. Each corm develops a persistent personality through episodic memory and trait evolution.

### Goroutines

1. **Transport Manager** — runs per-environment WebSocket listeners with automatic fallback to HTTP polling when WS disconnects. All environments share a single `eventChan`.
2. **Event Processor** — reads from `eventChan`, debounces events into per-session batches (configurable coalesce window + batch cap), then dispatches one LLM call per session group.
3. **Consolidation Loop** — periodic sweep across all environments/corms. Summarizes unconsolidated events into episodic memories via LLM, generates embeddings, runs deterministic trait reducers, and prunes memories exceeding the per-corm cap.

### Key Components

- **LLM Client** (`internal/llm`) — dual-endpoint client targeting Super (deep reasoning, port 8000) and Nano (fast extraction, port 8001) TRT-LLM models. Supports streaming and sync completion with optional reasoning disable.
- **LLM Post-Processor** (`internal/llm/postprocess.go`) — corruption garbling (replaces characters with noise glyphs proportional to corruption level), metadata leak sanitization (strips leaked event field patterns like `row=`, `session_id=`, angle-bracket artifacts, and ellipsis runs), response validation (rejects output without at least one 2+ alpha word), and response truncation.
- **Embedder** (`internal/embed`) — local nomic-embed model for memory vector generation. Supports single and batch embedding.
- **Memory Retriever** (`internal/memory`) — pgvector cosine similarity search over episodic memories. Touches recalled memories to update recency scoring.
- **Memory Consolidator** (`internal/memory`) — LLM-driven event summarization → embedding → storage. Deterministic trait reduction (agenda weights, patience, player affinities).
- **Memory Pruner** (`internal/memory/pruner.go`) — enforces per-corm memory caps by removing lowest-ranked memories when a corm exceeds its limit.
- **Chain Client** (`internal/chain`) — per-environment Sui RPC client for on-chain state writes (phase transitions, stability/corruption updates) using the corm-brain keypair. Includes stubs for contract creation (`contracts.go`), player inventory reading (`inventory.go`), and CORM token minting (`coin.go`).
- **Chain Signer** (`internal/chain/signer.go`) — Ed25519 keypair management for signing Sui transactions.
- **Reasoning Handler** (`internal/reasoning`) — orchestrates the full event→response pipeline: trait lookup, observation rate limiting (interval + jitter, not significance gating), memory recall, prompt building, LLM observation call (model decides via `[SILENCE]` whether to respond), response delivery, and phase effects. The LLM sees all events continuously and decides both *whether* and *what* to say.

### Phase-Specific Effects

- **Phase 0 Handler** (`internal/reasoning/phase0.go`) — observes phase transition events. When the puzzle-service detects the frustration trigger (3+ clicks on same button within 2 seconds), persists the phase=1 transition and syncs state.
- **Phase 1 Handler** (`internal/reasoning/phase1.go`) — handles decrypt and word-submit events with three active systems:
  - **Struggling Hint** — on every 4th consecutive incorrect submission, highlights a decrypted target-word cell (heatmap) or enables the signal hint globally if no target cells are decrypted yet.
  - **Guided Cell** — probabilistic (~25% per decrypt, reduced by corruption) system that sends a `guide_cell` action pointing the player toward the target, with distance-aware offset and alternating heatmap/vectors hint types. Immediately streams a directional narration via a dedicated LLM call.
  - **Boost Evaluation** — placeholder for boost targeting based on stability/corruption thresholds.
  - **Phase Transition** — transitions to Phase 2 when stability reaches 100.
- **Phase 2 Handler** (`internal/reasoning/phase2.go`) — handles contract completion/failure with state syncing. Contract generation logic (inventory reading, LLM-driven type selection, on-chain creation) is outlined but deferred.

### Test Harness

- **Harness** (`cmd/harness/`) — standalone test tool that impersonates the puzzle-service. Serves a WebSocket endpoint on `/corm/ws` so the corm-brain can connect unmodified, and provides an interactive CLI to inject player events and observe corm-brain responses in real time. Configurable via `HARNESS_PORT`, `HARNESS_SESSION_ID`, `HARNESS_PLAYER_ADDRESS`, `HARNESS_CONTEXT`.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Go
- **LLM Inference:** NVIDIA TRT-LLM (Nemotron 3 Super/Nano) hosted on DGX Spark
- **Embedding:** nomic-embed (local GGUF via cgo)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + pgvector
- **Blockchain:** Sui (via JSON-RPC)
- **Transport:** WebSocket (nhooyr.io/websocket) + HTTP fallback

## Configuration

All via environment variables (see `internal/config/config.go`):

- `WS_RECONNECT_MAX_MS` — max WS reconnect backoff (default: 30000ms)
- `FALLBACK_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` — HTTP poll interval (default: 2000ms)
- `ENVIRONMENTS_CONFIG` — path to JSON file for multi-environment setup (optional; falls back to single "default" env from legacy vars)

Per-environment config (in JSON file): `name`, `puzzle_service_url`, `sui_rpc_url`, `sui_private_key_env`, `corm_state_package_id`.

## Data Model

### Postgres Tables (managed by corm-brain migrations)

- `corm_traits` — per-corm personality state: phase, stability, corruption, agenda weights, patience, player affinities, contract type affinity, consolidation checkpoint
- `corm_events` — raw player events with environment, session, payload
- `corm_responses` — logged corm responses for conversational continuity
- `corm_memories` — episodic memories with pgvector embeddings, importance, type, source events, last-recalled timestamp

### On-Chain Objects

- `CormState` — shared object per corm (phase 0–6, stability 0–100, corruption 0–100)

## Deployment

- **Local:** built and run via `mprocs.yaml` using [air](https://github.com/air-verse/air) for live-reload on source changes (see `.air.toml`)
- **Production:** Docker container on ECS Fargate (planned)
- Requires: running Postgres with pgvector, DGX Spark LLM tunnel, Sui RPC access, funded Sui keypair
