# Web

## Overview

The web service is the React single-page application for Frontier Corm. It provides a wallet-connected interface where players manage tribes, create and fill trustless contracts, explore on-chain events, interact with the Continuity Engine (puzzle-service iframe), and view corm state — all backed by the indexer API and direct Sui RPC calls.

### Key Components

- **Identity Resolver** (`hooks/useIdentity`) — maps the connected Sui wallet to an Eve Frontier Character object. Provides `IdentityContext` to the entire app for character-aware UI.
- **Notification System** (`hooks/useNotifications`, `hooks/usePayoutWatcher`) — push-style notification provider. Payout watcher polls the indexer for contract fill/completion events targeting the current character and surfaces them as toast notifications.
- **Continuity Engine** (`continuity-engine/ContinuityEngine`) — embeds the puzzle-service as an iframe, providing the in-app gateway to the corm interaction. Includes `useCormState` and `useCormStateBridge` hooks for reading on-chain CormState and bridging it to the iframe, plus a `CormStateBar` component.
- **Auto-Join Tribe** (`hooks/useAutoJoinTribe`) — detects when the connected wallet’s Character belongs to an in-game tribe that has an on-chain Tribe, but the user hasn’t joined yet. Resolves via indexer events or on-chain registry lookup (`devInspect`). Exposes a one-click `self_join` action. Displayed via `AutoJoinBanner`.
- **Initialize Tribe** (`hooks/useInitializeTribe`, `InitializeTribeBanner`) — detects when the user’s in-game tribe has no on-chain Tribe and prompts creation.
- **Quick Actions** (`hooks/useQuickActions`) — configurable dashboard shortcuts for contract creation (CoinForCoin, CoinForItem, ItemForCoin, ItemForItem, Transport). Persisted to localStorage.
- **Indexer Error Handler** (`lib/api`) — global subscriber for indexer fetch errors, surfaced as error notifications.

### Shadow Location Network

Client-side privacy-preserving location sharing with ZK proof generation. The server never sees plaintext coordinates.

- **Location Crypto** (`lib/locationCrypto.ts`) — Poseidon4 hash commitment, AES-256-GCM encrypt/decrypt with TLK, X25519 TLK unwrap (ECIES), signature-derived X25519 keypair (deterministic from wallet’s `signPersonalMessage`), wallet auth challenge construction.
- **ZK Prover** (`lib/zkProver.ts`) — browser-side Groth16 proof generation via snarkjs. Generates region-filter proofs (3D bounding box containment), proximity-filter proofs (distance threshold), and mutual proximity proofs (two-structure distance within threshold). Circuit WASM + zkey files served by the indexer at `/zk/`.
- **Location PODs Hook** (`hooks/useLocationPods`) — fetches, decrypts, submits, and revokes location PODs. Handles TLK initialization, wrapped TLK fetching, Network Node POD registration and refresh. Caches wallet auth headers.
- **TLK Status Hook** (`hooks/useTlkStatus`) — checks TLK initialization state for a tribe.
- **TLK Distribution Hook** (`hooks/useTlkDistribution`) — manages wrapping TLK for pending tribe members.
- **ZK Filter Hook** (`hooks/useZkLocationFilter`) — generates and submits region/proximity/mutual proximity proofs for PODs, queries verified results. Supports named region/constellation proof by ID, and mutual proximity proofs between two decrypted PODs for witnessed contract fulfillment. Deduplicates Network Node derived PODs.
- **Region Data** (`lib/regions.ts`, `lib/solarSystems.ts`) — client-side region/constellation/solar system reference data with bounding boxes.
- **Locations Page** (`pages/LocationsPage`) — TLK status banner, decrypted POD listing grouped by solar system, register/revoke actions, pending member key distribution. "Prove Proximity" action launches mutual proximity proof modal.
- **POD Proof Modal** (`components/locations/PodProofModal`) — review and copy a shareable proof bundle for an owned POD. Displays public attestation fields (location hash, wallet signature, versions), associated ZK proofs, and location tags. Supports details and raw JSON views with copy-to-clipboard.
- **Mutual Proximity Proof Modal** (`components/locations/MutualProximityProofModal`) — select two decrypted PODs and a distance threshold, generate a Groth16 mutual proximity proof in-browser, and submit to the indexer. Shows actual distance, confirmation step, and success state. Used for fulfilling proximity-gated witnessed contracts.

### Forge Planner

- **Forge Planner Page** (`pages/ForgePlanner`) — three-tab interface: Blueprints (browse game blueprints), Planner (optimizer + build queue), Orders (active multi-input contracts with create/detail modals).
- **Blueprints Hook** (`hooks/useBlueprints`) — loads blueprint data from `/blueprints.json`, converts to `RecipeData[]` for the optimizer.
- **Optimizer Hook** (`hooks/useOptimizer`) — browser-side recipe tree resolution and gap analysis. Resolves a target item + quantity to a full dependency tree, collects leaf materials, and compares against inventory for a shopping list.
- **BOM Library** (`lib/bom.ts`) — Bill of Materials expansion at configurable depth (0 = finished items, 1 = direct inputs, ∞ = raw materials). Used by both optimizer UI and multi-input contract creation to generate slot lists.

### SSU Delivery dApp

- **SsuDeliveryDapp** (`pages/SsuDeliveryDapp`) — lightweight SSU-specific dApp for contract fulfillment. Fetches SSU metadata and inventory, filters contracts for deliverable items from the user’s player inventory, and provides a delivery modal. Rendered under `/dapp/ssu/:ssuId`.

### Page Routes

Per-environment defaults are defined in `config.ts` and overridden by explicit `VITE_*` vars. Environment files: `.env.localnet`, `.env.utopia`, `.env.stillness`.

## Deployment

- **Local:** `npm run dev` via `mprocs.yaml` (Vite dev server on :5173, proxies `/api` → indexer)
- **Production:** Static build deployed to S3 behind CloudFront
  - Build: `npm run build -- --mode utopia|stillness`
  - Deploy: `make deploy-frontend ENV=utopia|stillness` (S3 sync + CloudFront invalidation)
  - SPA routing: CloudFront 404 → `/index.html`

- Assembly metadata: user-defined structure names via on-chain MetadataRegistry, inline edit UI, indexer-backed batch reads
- Structure rows use a two-zone flex layout: left-aligned info tags (type, status, energy) with fixed min-widths for vertical alignment, and right-aligned action items (location, extension, online/offline buttons) pushed to the trailing edge. Same pattern applied to NetworkNodeGroup headers.
- Tribe member list includes a "Structures" column linking to each member's structures page (`/structures/:characterId`) for easy cross-member structure browsing
- Location badge deep-linking: the "📍 Location" badge on structure rows and network node headers links to `/locations?structure=<id>`, scrolling to and briefly highlighting the matching POD row on the Locations page

## Open Questions / Future Work

- Offline-capable PWA for mobile access
- Real-time event streaming (WebSocket from indexer) instead of polling
- Forge Planner: multi-recipe selection for optimizer, batch order creation
